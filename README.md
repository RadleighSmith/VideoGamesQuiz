Complemented by accents of #FEFFC3, a gentle pastel yellow, and #B074CA, a subtle lavender, the scheme achieves a harmonious balance.

Employing [contrast grids](https://contrast-grid.eightshapes.com/), we rigorously examined each color combination to ensure optimal readability and visual appeal. By adhering to this thoughtful approach, we have created a visually engaging and user-friendly interface that caters to a diverse audience. This attention to detail reflects our commitment to providing an inclusive and enjoyable experience for all players.

### Wireframes:

Prior to development, we employed wireframing techniques to carefully plan and structure the game's user interface. These wireframes served as a foundational blueprint, outlining the placement of key elements and interactions. By visualizing the layout early in the design process, we were able to refine the user experience, ensuring intuitive navigation and seamless gameplay. This systematic approach enabled us to streamline development efforts and create a polished, user-centric game interface.
